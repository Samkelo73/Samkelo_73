# RankNiye
The app was inspired by the recent increase in crime, missing people and to make things easy for people who use taxis as their transport. the app will be coded in Kotlin and Java and will use firefox to store its data. the App will have two features the first feature will have a map where people can automatically or manually set their current location. the second one will be a feature for people and drivers to communicate on the basis of hiring a tax. This App will help people who use taxis as their transport to find near taxi ranks, without stressing about going to ask people who may also rob them. It will also help taxi drivers to post their services e.g they can post when they are available for hire. in that case, people will be able to book them without any stress.
